To use this application, the host (or "actor") must have a windows pc with a Kinect
attached.  The hacked BodyBasics app must be running to receive the Kinect skeleton data
and transmit it over OSC.  Use Node to run kinectosctows.js daemon, to transmit the
Kinect OSC data over websockets.  Then use Node to run server.js, so you have a webserver
locally.  Finally, use your web browser to open actor.html.

Actor.html opens a websockets connection with server.js.  Server.js received the Kinect data via
websockets from kinectwstoosc


QUESTIONS

Want to convert kinectwstoosc into a webRTC server for datachannel -- this can be a peer, and browser can be a peer.
will peer.js run just in node, outside of browser?

also, can we strip out some of the kinect data, and just use the most important points (hands, feet, head)?

finally, can we get head position data?
